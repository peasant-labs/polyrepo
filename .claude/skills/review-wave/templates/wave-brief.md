# Wave brief — <repo> PR <n>[, <n>]

## 1. What this wave is

A coordinated review of <one PR | two sibling PRs> by three independent reviewers, one per lens:

- **Correctness** — does the implementation faithfully serve the issue and its invariants?
- **API design** — is the surface no larger than the problem; boundaries, naming, contracts?
- **Test quality** — fixtures, real services, observable assertions, `-race`?

Each reviewer reviews every PR and votes **ACCEPT** or **REVISE** per PR. The orchestrator curates
the findings afterwards into a two-part report: a short human document and a precise agent
document.

Scope boundaries to respect: <e.g. no routes, UI, migrations, dispatcher wiring; do not demand
them>. Do not propose <e.g. a scoring formula>. Review what is here against the acceptance.

## 2. Artifact(s)

| | PR <n> | PR <n> (if two) |
|---|---|---|
| URL | | |
| Issue | | |
| Head SHA | | |
| Merge base | | |
| Current default branch | | |
| Range | | |
| CI at SHA | | |

- Verify before trusting anything: `git -C <worktree> rev-parse HEAD` must equal the table's SHA,
  and `gh pr view <n> -R peasant-labs/<repo> --json headRefOid` must agree. State the verified SHA
  at the top of your report.
- Full patches: `<base-dir>/pr<n>.patch`.
- <UI or not; screenshots required or not.>
- <Prior review status: first review | prior findings listed in §6.>

## 3. Environment

- Reviewer A: `<base-dir>/a/pr<n>` (detached at the head SHA), `<base-dir>/a/pr<n>` integration
  scratch at the current default branch, DSN `<dsn-a>`.
- Reviewer B: `<base-dir>/b/...`, DSN `<dsn-b>`.
- Reviewer C: `<base-dir>/c/...`, DSN `<dsn-c>`.

PR checkouts are read-only. The integration checkout is disposable for local merge and generation
experiments: no commits, no pushes, reset it when done.

Test recipe (adjust to the repository's TESTING guide):

```sh
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="<dsn>"
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go vet -tags=integration ./... && gofmt -l .
go test -race ./...
go test -tags=integration -race ./internal/database/      # fresh empty base per run
```

Reset the base database before each full-package run; integration tests run the migrations
themselves. <Note any gates that cannot run locally and why; CI covers them at the SHA.>

## 4. Issue requirements and acceptance

**Problem.** <bullets>

**Scope.** <numbered bullets from the issue>

**Acceptance.** <verbatim bullets from the issue>

**Open decisions.** <rulings the issue leaves open, if any>

## 5. Epic and invariants

<The invariants and boundaries this PR must honor, with references.>

## 6. Prior review items (re-reviews only)

Every item from the previous review at the prior SHA must be confirmed or refuted against the
current build, with evidence. Do not re-review only the fix.

1. <prior finding> — <location, what to check>
2. …

## 7. Specific parity and verification pointers

- <The extraction or move to diff against its previous implementation.>
- <Callers that must behave identically.>
- <Tests or fixtures the acceptance names, and whether they exist.>
- <Generated output that must regenerate with zero diff.>

## 8. Repository rules

- Test cases live in named YAML fixtures with required-name manifests; closed sets assert exact
  membership; the subject is never mocked; integration tests use real services with `-race`.
- Generated files are regenerated with the pinned tool, never hand-edited.
- <Contract ceremony, migration immutability, docs same-commit rules as applicable.>
- No internal task taxonomy in code, docs, comments, or reports; public-audience prose.

## 9. Output contract for each reviewer

Write `<base-dir>/report-<a|b|c>.md` with:

1. **Verdict** at the verified SHA — `ACCEPT` or `REVISE` (binary).
2. **Problem statement** — grounded in the issue, in your own words.
3. **Constraints** — the binding rules that shaped the solution.
4. **Requirements** — mapped to where the code implements each.
5. **Acceptance criteria** — each issue bullet assessed met / partial / deferred with evidence.
6. **Developed solution** — what was built, key files, mechanism end to end.
7. **Tradeoffs** — decisions taken, alternatives not taken, costs.
8. **Findings** ranked `BLOCKER` / `IMPORTANT` / `MINOR`, each with `path:line`, a concrete
   scenario, impact, and a specific fix.
9. **An explanatory ASCII diagram** of the mechanism as built.
10. **At least one `c4` diagram**, linted:
    `python3 /home/minttea/dev/peasant-labs/.claude/skills/c4-model/scripts/c4-lint.py <report>` —
    exit 0 required.
11. **Checks run / skipped** with exact commands and observed results, and coverage limits.
12. **Integration with the current default branch** — merge, generation, and relevant tests.

## 10. Reviewer constraints

- Read-only on the PR checkouts; scratch experiments only in your own integration checkout; no
  edits, commits, or pushes.
- No Beads writes, no GitHub comments; the orchestrator consolidates and posts.
- No `bd dolt push/pull`; no `aura-swarm`.
- Time-box by prioritizing the load-bearing checks; <skip list and why>.

Operating mechanics behind SKILL.md: isolation, databases, reviewer prompts, curation, posting, Beads records, housekeeping. Kept out of the skill body; SKILL.md carries the requirements.

# Review wave (peasant-labs)

Run an independent, evidence-based review of one or two sibling pull requests and produce a
curated report the author can act on. The reviewers stop at findings; the orchestrator verifies
the load-bearing ones, decides what is worth keeping, and writes the public report.

This skill is the orchestrator side of the review. The reviewer side is the `/reviewer` skill and
the `reviewer` subagent. Coordinate severity trees with `impl-review` when the work is a pasture
epoch; this skill also works for ad-hoc PR review outside an epoch.

## What a wave produces

- A verdict per PR: `ready` or `changes requested`, with severity-ranked findings
  (`BLOCKER` / `IMPORTANT` / `MINOR`).
- A curated report posted to the PR as one comment with two documents: a short human part first,
  then a precise agent part.
- Beads records: one review task per wave, one task per reviewed PR, three reviewer tasks, three
  severity groups, and one task per finding.
- Raw reviewer reports kept outside the repository (for example under `/tmp/opencode/<topic>/`).

## Inputs and preconditions

- One or two PR numbers or URLs in the same repository; for two PRs they should be siblings in one
  feature area (they share migrations, docs, or boundaries worth reviewing together).
- `gh auth status` succeeds; the user can write comments on the PRs.
- No open PR owned by someone else is being reviewed without user approval.

Resolve the repository before any command. Never rely on a bare PR number: PR numbers overlap
between repositories, and Peasant and Village have archive remotes.

| Product repository | GitHub repository | Local host | Default branch | Live remote |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Peasant | `peasant-labs/peasant` | `peasant/` | `develop` | `canonical` |
| Village | `peasant-labs/village` | `village/` | `develop` | `canonical` |
| Schema | `peasant-labs/schema` | `schema/` | `develop` | `origin` |
| Fairtrade | `peasant-labs/fairtrade-design-system` | `fairtrade-design-system/` | `main` | `origin` |

Unknown repository: read its `AGENTS.md` and check `git remote -v` before acting.

## Phase 0 — Recon

Read the PR, its issue, and any epic it belongs to. Verify the head locally and on GitHub. Check
the base, the current default branch, and prior review records.

```sh
GH_REPO="peasant-labs/<repo>"
PR=<number>
LIVE_REMOTE="canonical"   # or origin
REPO_HOST="/home/minttea/dev/peasant-labs/<repo-host>"

gh pr view "$PR" -R "$GH_REPO" --json title,author,state,isDraft,body,baseRefName,headRefOid, \
  mergeable,mergeStateStatus,additions,deletions,files,comments,statusCheckRollup
gh issue view <issue> -R "$GH_REPO" --json title,body,comments
git -C "$REPO_HOST" fetch "$LIVE_REMOTE" --quiet
BASE_SHA=$(git -C "$REPO_HOST" rev-parse "$LIVE_REMOTE/develop")
git -C "$REPO_HOST" merge-base "$BASE_SHA" <head-sha>
git -C "$REPO_HOST" diff --shortstat <merge-base>..<head-sha>
git -C "$REPO_HOST" diff --name-only <merge-base>..<head-sha>
git -C "$REPO_HOST" diff --name-only <merge-base>.."$BASE_SHA"   # default-branch delta and overlap
```

Collect before designing the wave:

- The exact head SHA from `headRefOid`; record it and never review a different one.
- The merge base and the current default branch. If the default branch moved, note the delta and
  any file overlap with the PR; the reviewers need it for the integration check.
- CI status at the head (`statusCheckRollup`) and any known environment limitations the author
  reported.
- The issue's scope and acceptance bullets, plus any epic invariants the PR must honor.
- Prior review records: `bd search <topic>`, `bd list -l <repo>`; if the PR was reviewed before,
  the prior findings become the standing checklist every reviewer must re-walk against the current
  SHA. Never re-review only the fix.
- External constraints the review will depend on: if a finding hinges on a vendor or protocol
  contract (API caps, pagination limits, error semantics), fetch the current documentation and
  quote it. Do not rely on memory.

## Phase 1 — Isolate

One PR checkout per reviewer, detached at the exact head SHA, plus one disposable integration
checkout at the current default branch. For a two-PR wave, create one checkout per PR per reviewer
(`pr<n>` and `pr<m>`). PR checkouts stay pristine; scratch work happens only in the integration
checkout.

```sh
BASE_DIR=/tmp/opencode/<topic>
for X in a b c; do
  mkdir -p "$BASE_DIR/$X"
  git -C "$REPO_HOST" worktree add --detach "$BASE_DIR/$X/pr<number>" <head-sha>
  git -C "$REPO_HOST" worktree add -b review-<pr>-<X>-integration \
    "$BASE_DIR/$X/integration" "$BASE_SHA"
done
gh pr diff "$PR" -R "$GH_REPO" > "$BASE_DIR/pr<number>.patch"
```

For PostgreSQL-backed repositories (Village), give each reviewer its own disposable cluster with
an empty base database. Integration tests run the migrations themselves; never pre-migrate the
base, and reset it before each full-package run.

```sh
# One cluster per reviewer (a/b/c), unix socket in the wave directory.
initdb -D "$BASE_DIR/pg-$X" -U test --auth=trust --no-locale -E UTF8
printf 'port = %s\nunix_socket_directories = %s\n' "$PORT" "$BASE_DIR" >> "$BASE_DIR/pg-$X/postgresql.conf"
pg_ctl -D "$BASE_DIR/pg-$X" -l "$BASE_DIR/pg-$X/server.log" start
dropdb -h 127.0.0.1 -p "$PORT" -U test --if-exists <db> --force
createdb -h 127.0.0.1 -p "$PORT" -U test <db>
```

Record the worktree paths and DSNs in the brief. Pick three free ports and keep the mapping
consistent for the whole wave.

## Phase 2 — Write the wave brief

Write one brief file at `$BASE_DIR/wave-brief.md` from `templates/wave-brief.md`. It carries
everything the reviewers need so they never guess: artifact table with exact SHAs, environment and
DSNs, issue requirements and acceptance, epic invariants, the prior checklist for re-reviews,
specific parity or verification pointers, repository rules, and the output contract.

Rules for the brief:

- State the reviewed SHA and how to verify it (`git rev-parse HEAD`; `gh pr view --json headRefOid`).
- Quote the acceptance bullets; do not summarize them away.
- State scope boundaries so reviewers do not demand out-of-scope work (routes, UI, migrations,
  scoring formulas, and so on).
- Point at areas worth verifying; do not seed findings. The reviewers must find them.
- Keep the reviewers' own constraints in the brief: read-only checkouts, scratch only in the
  integration checkout, no Beads or GitHub writes, no pushes, time-box.

## Phase 3 — Spawn reviewers

Run three `reviewer` subagents in **one parallel batch**, one per lens. Each reviewer covers every PR in the wave:

- **Correctness** — does the implementation faithfully serve the issue and its invariants; are
  there gaps, regressions, or claims the code does not support?
- **API design** — is the surface no larger than the problem; boundaries, naming, contracts,
  over- and under-engineering.
- **Test quality** — fixtures with required names, exact membership, strict decoding, real
  services instead of mocking the subject, observable assertions, `-race`.

Each prompt starts with `/reviewer`, names its lens, points at `$BASE_DIR/wave-brief.md`, and
gives: its worktree, its DSN, the report path it must write, and these constraints:

- Verify the SHA before reviewing anything.
- Write the report with bash heredocs (`cat > … <<'EOF'`); the `edit` tool is denied to reviewers.
- Produce a verdict (`ACCEPT` / `REVISE`), problem statement, constraints, requirements,
  acceptance status, developed solution, tradeoffs, ranked findings with `path:line`, a concrete
  scenario, impact and a fix, an explanatory ASCII diagram, at least one `c4` diagram, checks run
  and skipped, and the integration result against the current default branch.
- Lint every `c4` block with
  `python3 /home/minttea/dev/peasant-labs/.claude/skills/c4-model/scripts/c4-lint.py <report>`
  until it exits 0.
- Public-audience prose: no internal task IDs, slice or phase names, or workflow taxonomy.
- No edits, commits, pushes, Beads writes, or GitHub comments; no `bd dolt push/pull`; no
  `aura-swarm`.
- Never hand a subagent a bare PR number as its only target; give the SHA and local paths.

Reviewers are foreground teammates: spawn them together and wait for all three before curating.

## Phase 4 — Curate the findings

Read all three reports in full. Treat them as evidence, not verdicts. For every finding that would
change the report's verdict or a proposed fix:

- Reproduce or verify it yourself when it is cheap: read the code the finding cites, run the test
  or the SQL, replay the interleaving, fetch the vendor documentation.
- Check it against the issue and the repository rules; a finding can be real code behavior and
  still be out of scope or contradicted by the acceptance.
- Keep only findings with real impact: a defect, a missed acceptance item, a contract or
  validation gap, or documentation that would mislead. Drop impact-free style or process
  comments.
- Decide one disposition per finding and record it: keep, downgrade, or drop, with the reason.
  Note disagreements between reviewers and how they were resolved.
- Fold duplicates from different reviewers into one finding with the best evidence.
- Keep the severity rubric: `BLOCKER` (wrong or harmful results on the production path, security,
  broken gates), `IMPORTANT` (missing validation or coverage at a boundary, contract problems),
  `MINOR` (hygiene, clarity, optional hardening).
- One-line documentation fixes can be the most valuable findings when the current text would
  mislead the next agent or operator, or when the corrected text prevents a whole class of wrong
  assumptions. Treat them seriously, and say why.
- Merge policy is zero blockers; important and minor findings route to follow-ups. Do not silently
  downgrade a blocker — if you disagree with a reviewer, record the evidence and surface the
  dispute.

## Phase 5 — Write the two-part report

Write one file, `$BASE_DIR/review-<pr>.md`, and show the user its absolute path. The file becomes
one PR comment with two documents, human part first, agent part second.

**Part 1 — for humans.** Short bullets, no walls of text.

- Problem statement: what the PR is for and why it matters, in a few bullets.
- Findings and proposed fixes: **exactly one table** with one row per finding.
- A few ASCII diagrams that show the mechanism and the main defect and its fix.
- Tradeoffs as bullets.
- Glossary at the end: the codebase and domain terms a reader needs.

**Part 2 — for agents.** Precise and unambiguous.

- Artifact and provenance: PR, issue, exact head SHA, merge base, current default branch, diff
  size, CI status, verdict.
- Acceptance status: one row per acceptance bullet with status and `path:line` evidence; tables are
  allowed here.
- One section per finding: location, symptom, reproduction or evidence, impact, required change,
  tests to add, alternatives with tradeoffs, and a small ASCII diagram of the fix when it is not
  obvious from the description (a blocker always gets one).
- Verification run: exact commands and observed results, plus what was intentionally skipped.
- One `c4` diagram (linted) and the integration result against the current default branch.

Terminology rules for both parts: use industry-standard terms or terms already in the codebase.
Do not invent vocabulary; describe behavior instead (for example "returns the complete list or an
error", not a coined name for it). No internal task IDs, slice/phase names, or workflow taxonomy
in posted text. Keep the whole comment under GitHub's 65,536-character limit.

## Phase 6 — Post and record

- Post with `gh pr comment <pr> -R "$GH_REPO" --body-file "$BASE_DIR/review-<pr>.md"`. Post only
  with user approval unless the user has already told you to post.
- Verify the published body: fetch it back and check its length, first line, and that both parts
  are present.
- Record the wave in Beads:
  - One review task per wave, referencing the PR, issue, and exact SHA.
  - One reviewer task per lens; add each verdict as a comment.
  - Three severity group tasks, created eagerly even when empty; close empty ones.
  - One task per kept finding, wired to its severity group; a BLOCKER blocks both its severity
    group and the review task.
  - Comment the posted comment URL on the review task.
  - For re-reviews, comment on each carried finding that it was re-verified at the new SHA, and
    update any finding whose status changed.
- When the PR later gets a new head, that head needs a new wave; a clean review of an older SHA
  does not carry over, and the re-review walks the entire prior checklist again.

## Phase 7 — Housekeeping

- Leave PR checkouts pristine; reset the integration checkouts (`git reset --hard <sha>`).
- Keep raw reports and the brief under `/tmp/opencode/<topic>/`; never commit review evidence.
- Remove the review worktrees and branches you created after the PR lands; never remove another
  agent's worktree.
- After the reviewed PRs merge, the wave is closed: no follow-up work is owed unless the user
  asks; leave the findings record in place and update it only on request.
- Database clusters may stay running between waves; reset the base database before a new
  full-package run.

## Hard rules

1. Verify the head SHA locally and on GitHub before any review statement; a stale SHA invalidates
   the wave.
2. Reviewers make no edits, commits, pushes, Beads writes, or GitHub posts; they return findings.
3. Never hand a subagent a bare PR number as its only target.
4. Never accept reviewer findings as gospel: reproduce load-bearing claims and record every
   keep/downgrade/drop decision with its reason.
5. Never demand out-of-scope work; check each finding against the issue and the repository rules.
6. Never silently downgrade a blocker; a disputed blocker goes to the user with the evidence.
7. Public text uses industry-standard or codebase terms only — no invented vocabulary and no
   internal task taxonomy.
8. Generated files are never hand-merged; fixture and manifest rules apply to any proposed fix.
9. Post to the PR only with user approval unless the user already said to post.
10. A new head SHA means a new wave; re-reviews walk the entire prior checklist.

## Stop and ask

- The head SHA changes mid-wave; restart on the new SHA.
- Reviewers disagree on a blocker you cannot settle with evidence.
- A finding depends on external behavior you cannot verify (vendor API, production config).
- The issue leaves a product or scope decision open that the review cannot resolve.
- The landing order between two sibling PRs is ambiguous after the merge simulation.
